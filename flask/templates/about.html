        <p class="lead mb-4">
            Hi! I'm Kareem, an Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering student with a passion for combining 
            technology with space exploration and scientific discovery.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
            I love working on projects that bridge different fields - in this case, bringing together machine learning, 
            astronomy, and web development. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about space missions, 
            experimenting with new programming frameworks, or working on electronics projects.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
            Celara represents my interest in using artificial intelligence to solve real scientific problems. 
            It's exciting to think that the same techniques used in everyday apps can help us discover new worlds 
            orbiting distant stars!

        <h3 class="mb-4">About Celara</h3>
        
        <!-- What is Celara? (Beginner-friendly) -->
        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3"><i class="bi bi-question-circle"></i> What is Celara?</h4>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Think of Celara as a smart detective for finding planets around other stars.</strong> 
            Just like how a detective looks for clues to solve a case, Celara looks for tiny patterns in starlight 
            that might indicate a planet is passing in front of the star.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
            When a planet crosses in front of its star (like a mini-eclipse), it blocks a tiny amount of light - 
            sometimes less than 1%! These dips in brightness create a pattern called a "light curve." 
            Celara uses artificial intelligence to analyze thousands of these light curves and determine 
            which ones are most likely caused by planets rather than other phenomena.
        </p>
        
        <!-- How does it work? (Beginner-friendly) -->
        <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3"><i class="bi bi-gear-fill"></i> How Does It Work?</h4>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Step 1: Get the Data</strong><br>
            You can upload data in three ways: a spreadsheet with planet measurements, raw telescope data files, 
            or just type in a planet candidate number and Celara will download the data automatically from NASA.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Step 2: AI Analysis</strong><br>
            Celara's "brain" (a neural network) examines the light patterns. It's been trained on thousands of 
            examples of real planets and false alarms, so it learns to spot the difference.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Step 3: Results</strong><br>
            You get a percentage score for each candidate - higher scores mean "more likely to be a planet." 
            Celara also shows you graphs and statistics to help you understand what it found.
        </p>

        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            <i class="bi bi-exclamation-triangle me-2"></i>
            <strong>For Developers & Researchers:</strong> The following section contains technical implementation details.
        </div>
        
        <p class="mb-3">
            <strong>Neural Network Architecture:</strong> Celara implements a multi-modal deep learning approach 
            based on Google's AstroNet, combining three specialized branches:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="mb-4">
            <li><strong>Local View Branch:</strong> 1D ResNet processing 201-point folded light curves focused on transit windows</li>
            <li><strong>Global View Branch:</strong> 1D ResNet analyzing 2001-point full orbital period data</li>
            <li><strong>Auxiliary Branch:</strong> Dense layers processing stellar parameters (radius, temperature, SNR)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="mb-3">
            <strong>Model Specifications:</strong> The network uses approximately 71,000 parameters with Global Average Pooling 
            for computational efficiency. Feature extraction creates a 2206-dimensional space combining temporal patterns 
            and astrophysical constraints. Confidence scoring provides prediction reliability based on distance from the decision boundary 
            Bayesian approximation.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-3">
            <strong>Data Pipeline:</strong> Built with Python scientific stack including Lightkurve for NASA mission data handling, 
            Astropy for coordinate transformations and FITS processing, and Pandas for tabular data manipulation. 
            Supports Kepler/K2 and TESS light curves with automatic detrending and normalization.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Web Infrastructure:</strong> Flask backend with RESTful API design, Bootstrap 5 responsive frontend, 
            WebSocket integration for real-time progress updates, and containerized deployment options. 
            Includes automated testing pipeline and CI/CD integration.
        </p>

            <strong>Open Source:</strong> The complete source code, model architecture, and training notebooks 
            are available on GitHub, following reproducible research practices and scientific transparency principles.
